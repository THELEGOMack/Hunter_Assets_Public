This is the official public asset release of all the custom sprites used in the Hunter series of HM2 workshop campaigns, including those from SF 2016 and unused ones. Unmodified sprites/frames have been deleted for easier readability. Free for you to use and modify, all I ask for is credit! You also have my full permission to make any fan levels/campaigns/etc. with the help of this dump, if you wish.

Most sprites have been made by me, with additional help from 1337spy, Alepacho, BroccoliWalkway, Cam, ChargerHM, CrazyJaydon, Danny Judas, Dapp_y, DogFromChicago, Dr. Wizard, Elliot, Fencing Man, Fusilli, Magnum, @MariaRook1, MusicJab, Phil, perforator, PSG, Psycho Named Jerry, Ranino, Rob Salmon, Shosray, thebasicbrick, Toxic Coffee, UberDuex, Uznach, YaanVasovich, YossarianTheAssyrian, and anyone not listed here who had contributed cameos.

If you contributed any sprite(s) to this series and don't want to have them used publicly, please DM me.
And if there's any sprites missing here, let me know and I will update this repository!
